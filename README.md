# MolecularWeightCalculator
Calculate the Molecular Weight of any chemical substance using its Molecular Formula.

This code is written in C++ to calculate the molecular weight of any chemical compound using the molecular formula. <br />
I considered the atomic weight from the [ACADEMIA Website](https://www.academia.edu/29928134/TABLE_OF_ELEMENTS_AND_THEIR_ATOMIC_WEIGHTS) <br />
This C++ exe considers the input in string format.
For example, if you write the chemical formula of benzene in the executable output, C6H6, it will generate the molecular formula of benzene. <br />
