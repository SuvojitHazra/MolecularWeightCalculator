# MolecularWeightCalculator
Calculate the Molecular Weight of any chemical substance using its Molecular Formula.

This code is written in C++ to calculate the molecular weight of any chemical compound using the molecular formula. <br />
I considered the atomic weight from the [ACADEMIA Website](https://www.academia.edu/29928134/TABLE_OF_ELEMENTS_AND_THEIR_ATOMIC_WEIGHTS) <br />
This C++ exe considers the input in string format.
For example, if you write the chemical formula of benzene in the executable output, C6H6, it will generate the molecular formula of benzene. <br />

**Usage details:** <br /><br />
 **Step-1:** Double-click the C++ executable '**mol wt.exe**'. This will appear:<br /><br />

 **Step-2:** Enter the molecular formula. let's use benzene, C6H6 in the executable and press **Enter**.<br /><br />

 **Step-3:** This program will output the molecular weight like as following:<br /><br />
